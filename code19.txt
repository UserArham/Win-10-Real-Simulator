/* Taskbar and clock notes */

- The taskbar is fixed at the bottom with `#taskbar`.
- The clock updates every second using `setInterval`.
- Time format uses `toLocaleTimeString` with 2-digit hour and minute.
- Start button toggles `#start-menu` visibility with `.hidden` class.
- Start menu items launch apps via the same `openApp()` function as desktop icons.
