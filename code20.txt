/* Icon and start menu notes */

- Desktop icons use `.icon` class with `data-app` attributes.
- Double-clicking an icon opens its corresponding app window.
- Start menu items `<li>` also have `data-app` and open apps on click.
- CSS ensures icons are visually distinct and aligned.
- Hover effects indicate interactivity for both desktop and start menu icons.
