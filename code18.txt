/* Drag-and-drop behavior notes */

- Windows are draggable by the `.window-header`.
- Movement is tracked via `mousedown`, `mousemove`, and `mouseup` events.
- The offset from mouse click to window top-left is stored in `offsetX` and `offsetY`.
- When `isDown` is true, the window follows the cursor.
- Closing a window removes its DOM element.
