/* Final notes on apps and windows */

- Each app runs inside its own `<iframe>` for isolation.
- Windows can be dragged, moved, and closed independently.
- Start menu and desktop icons both launch apps via the same `openApp()` function.
- CSS ensures consistent styling for windows, headers, and taskbar.
- This simulator is a minimal example and can be extended freely.
