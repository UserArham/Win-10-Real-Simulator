/* Styling notes */

- `.window` uses fixed width and height, with `box-shadow` and `border`.
- `.window-header` has background color `#0078d7` and white text.
- `.window-close` is styled to look like a clickable “✕” button.
- `.window-body` contains an `<iframe>` that loads the app HTML.
- `.hidden` class is used throughout to toggle visibility for menus/windows.
