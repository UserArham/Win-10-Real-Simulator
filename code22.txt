/* Assets handling notes */

- `/assets/icons/` contains icon images for apps (placeholders in this version).
- `/assets/wallpaper.jpg` is the desktop background (currently empty).
- Images are referenced via relative paths in HTML and CSS.
- Additional icons can be added for new apps; ensure filenames match `data-app`.
- Wallpaper can be replaced by updating `background` property in `#desktop`.
